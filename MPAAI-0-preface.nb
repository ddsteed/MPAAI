I started using Mathematica about 10 years ago for my Masters thesis. Since \
then, I have been using it occasionally during my PhD, until about 3 years \
ago. At that point, just for curiosity, I tried to use Mathematica for a \
small side project which had nothing to do with the field of my professional \
activity (theoretical physics). And then, I have suddenly discovered that \
behind all the built-in commands and simple procedural programming constructs \
there is a much more powerful programming language (the fact of course \
well-known by then to lots of people, but not to me). I was hooked and spent \
some time experimenting with its different features and then read a few books \
to get a deeper insight into it. At that time, it was mostly for my own \
amusement, since ways in which I used Mathematica professionally did not \
require even a fraction of the full power of this language. However, the \
character of my work has changed since, and it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been about \
one and a half years now that I use Mathematica heavily on a daily basis and \
very frequently need the full power it can give me, in terms of speed, \
numerical and symbolic capabilities. And I can safely say that without the \
knowledge of how to program in it properly, most of my recent scientific \
results would be a lot harder to get. At some point, I decided to create some \
notes on Mathematica programming, mainly for myself, and also to somehow \
organize the code that I have accumulated so far for various projects. But as \
the notes started to expand, it occurred to me that with some more effort I \
could convert them into a text possibly useful for other people. So, that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how it started.\

At the end of the day, there is nothing that can be done in Mathematica and \
absolutely can not be done in other programming environments. For many \
problems however, especially those involving symbolic programming, solving a \
problem in a language such as C or C++ will be eventually equivalent to \
reimplementing a subset of Mathematica (or other system for symbolic \
manipulations) needed to solve the problem. The point is that many things are \
done in Mathematica with less or a lot less effort and time, because a lot of \
both generic and specific functionality is already built in Mathematica. And \
because it is so general, I expect this statement to be true for almost any \
field where some computations, prototype or program design and development, \
simulations etc are used. Mathematica seems to be an ideal tool for
development of toy-models, prototypes, or just ideas. While Mathematica may \
be also quite useful for validating some ideas or solutions, as well as to \
power some quite complex technologies also in their final form, my feeling is \
that it may be most useful as a tool of experimental research (or \
programming), where the answer (or design) is not known in advance.\

On the other hand, there are many great programming languages, environments \
and tools. Many of them have an added advantage of being free and open \
source. For the programming and prototype design purposes, one may well \
question the advantages of using a proprietary software, which also is \
intrinsically built in a way that does not allow to make an executable \
directly (it would require to package the entire kernel together with your \
code and lead to a very large size of an executable. The Mathematica Player \

I firmly believe that the best way to learn Mathematica programming is to \
learn it as a natural language. Mathematica programming language is very rich \
and in fact \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]overcomplete\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in \
the sense that many built-in functions are in principle derivable from other \
builit-in functions or their combinations. However, it is not an unstructured \
collection of functions \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for everything\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] --- it is built on powerful principles and has a \
uniform structure. To find a way through this large number of commands and \
understand their relative importance and relevance for a particular problem, \
it seems best to me to study the main principles and the structure of the \
language, but then go through the many language idioms and illustrate the use \
of each with many examples.\

Thus, my way of presenting Mathematica programming can be characterized as \
language-driven and example-driven, but, unlike many other books, I do not \
cover separately different programming styles (procedural, rule-based, \
functional). Rather, I try to often give more than one implementation for a \
solution to a given problem, usually using different programming styles, and \
then discuss the differences, advantages and disadvantages of each on the \
level of individual examples. Because really, choosing your programming style \
before you start to understand the problem is like choosing tools to fix the \
car without knowing what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s broken. For the same reasons, I \
deliberately avoided discussions of any of thousands of the specialized tasks \
that Mathematica can perform, and instead considered it from a pure programming
viewpoint. If we can imagine such a thing as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mathematica cookbook\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], then I \
tried to make my book the exact opposite of it.\

The examples I give are increasing in complexity as we go along, and in some \
cases I use constructs not yet covered, just for illustration (in such cases, \
it is best to concentrate on the part of the code which is currently \
discussed and ignore the unclear pieces, but revisit them later). However, \
many examples are admittedly rather contrived. This is because they serve to \
illustrate a given language idiom in the simplest possible setting. You will \
notice that many of the examples are concerned with imitation of the \
functionality of some built-in commands. This is not because I could not come \
up with more informative examples demonstrating the application of \
Mathematica to some \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]real world\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
problems, but because they are useful in understanding the system. By \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]reproducing\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one built-in \
function with some combination of others, we not only learn about the \
inter-relations of various built-in commands, but also about performance wins \
and losses, avoiding the frustration associated with learning the same things \
