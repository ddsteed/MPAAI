Mathematica is distant from many other programming languages in many ways. \
One that seems most important to me is that it is not a minimal language, in \
the sense I will explain. This leads to lots of ways of how any given problem \
can be solved. Mathematica language supports all major programming \
styles-procedural, rule-based, functional and object-oriented (OO is not \
directly supported but can be implemented within Mathematica [3,4,1]) . This \

say that Mathematica language is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]problem-oriented\

When I program in C, and say solve some problem in two different ways, it is \
not very likely that the performance of the two implementations will be \
different more than a factor of 2 (unless I do something stupid, or when the \
difference in solutions will be actually in algorithms of different \
complexity). In Mathematica however, it is quite easy to get say 5 or 10 \
different solutions where the performance of the most and least efficient may \
differ in several orders of magnitude or have different computational \
complexity altogether. Of course, the reason is that, programming in \
Mathematica, we \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sit\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] on top of \
a lot of internal algorithms used to implement given built-in functions that \
we are using. But from the user viewpoint, these performance differences are \
often completely unobvious, until one gets a better understanding

processing, each one taking as an input a result from the previous one. And \
then, on each stage we produce 2 different solutions which differ in \
performance 10 times. At the end, we get one system working 10000 faster than \

anyway exists an overhead due to the symbolic nature of Mathematica and a \
very high level of its language. If one wants to build something serious and \

At the same time, the great advantages that Mathematica brings are the ease \
and speed of writing and debugging the code, the extremely small code size, \
and the ability to stay on quite a high level of abstraction throughout the \
process of solving the problem, without going into unnecessary low-level \
details which hide the essence of the problem. This allows a single person to \
manage substantial projects. Mathematica is a great \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]thinking laboratory\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Due to \
its highly interactive nature, it is also a great tool to design and analyze \
algorithms. For me personally, this overweights the eventual complications \
arising from the above performance issues, especially because once you \
understand the system, you rarely get an unexpected
behavior or nasty performance surprises.\

own definitions at run-time (for example, we may program a function that \

even produce such \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]disposable\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \

The availability and effectiveness of functional programming style allows to \
both make the code more concise and create data structures on the fly (since \
in this approach any complex data structure is represented by a possibly \
nested list). If however one wants to shift the accents more towards data \
structures, this is also possible and easy thanks to the syntax-based \
pattern-matching and rule substitution. And because in Mathematica functional \
programming can be performed on general Mathematica expressions (more general \
than lists - this is made non-trivial by pattern-matching), one can also \
combine the two programming styles to shift the relative roles of functions \
and data structures as to feel most comfortable. It is typical in Mathematica \
programming to use functional programming in the more exploratory stage and \
then create more rigid data types and structures after the design has shaped.\

The large number of built-in functions has both advantages and disadvantages. \
To list just a few advantages: you get a huge collection of (often very \
sophisticated) algorithms already implemented, tested etc., packaged in \
built-ins. Extended Help system and error messages allow to very quickly \
learn new functionality, write and debug programs. However, while the \
capabilities of Mathematica such as pattern-matching and rules substitution \

From the programmer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s point of view, the speed of writing \

person to manage quite large projects. The mechanism of packages provides a \

functionality in non-trivial ways, one can develop different and possibly \
novel ways of both programming and thinking about problems. The underlying \
rule-based nature of Mathematica makes it possible to remove many \
restrictions on what can be done in principle, typical for more traditional \
languages. The price to pay is often efficiency issues. Getting familiar with \
Mathematica on a deeper level can help deal with them in many cases.\
